# A Timeline Project

This repository was created for an assignment Foundations in Instructional Technology at [American College of Education](https://ace.edu).
Notes:

- In order to make the vertical timeline work properly, NextJS version 13.4.8 was used. If you update the version of NextJS, it is possible for the visibility and animations of the timeline to stop working.
- Use the data.ts file to control your page content.
- To adjust colors, you will need to edit the layout.tsx and page.tsx files.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
